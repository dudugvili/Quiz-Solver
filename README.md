# Quiz-Solver
A software I've built in python with ui to solve a home quiz i got in my class with dynamic programming.

The quiz was delivered through the web with random data and the goal was to solve it with dynamic programming,
i did so and added an extra ui to solve the quiz with any data/numbers given.

## An example of a question (question number 3):

# The questions were:
### 1 - Given string S, find the longest word that apears in it, legit words are declared in the dict.txt file attached.

example: S = S = highballsmtgephalangeroutmalaproppinginflammatory

         the longest word is outmalapropping and it length is 15
         
### 2 - Given string S, find all palindrome subsequences, without singular groups, calculate the sum of the subsequences number and the length of the longest one

example: S = CACADABEEDBEBAACCEDCDAEBEBCECBCEECBCDEDEBEBCABEDDCEABCDEAACBBADABDCACCECABABCEBCACCDDCEDADABEACDABCA

         the longest palindrome is 'CBCEECBC', and the sum of it length and number of palindromes in string is - 34
         
### 3 - Given 3 series of numbers, find the longest common subsequence.

example: A1={2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2}

A2={1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1}

A3={2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1}
         
         the length of LCS is 8
         
### 4 - Given series L of numbers, find the length of the longest monotone series.

example: L={1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0}
    
    the longest monotone series is 27
